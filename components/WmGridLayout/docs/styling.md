# Styling

## CSS Classes

The layoutgrid component provides the following CSS classes for styling:

### Component-Specific Classes

- **`.app-layoutgrid`** - Default style class that provides the base styling for the layout grid component
- **`.table`** - Applies table-specific styling to create a structured grid layout with proper spacing and alignment
- **`.table-header-label`** - Styles the header labels within the table layout, typically providing distinct typography and positioning for column headers

### Usage

These classes can be used individually or combined to achieve the desired visual appearance. The base `.app-layoutgrid` class should typically be applied to the root component element, while `.table` and `.table-header-label` classes target specific elements within the grid structure.

You can also apply standard application CSS classes alongside these component-specific classes for additional customization.
