# Overview

The LayoutGrid component is a flexible container component designed to organize and structure content within mobile applications using a grid-based layout system. It serves as a foundational building block for creating responsive, well-organized interfaces by arranging child components in a structured grid pattern that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

This component is particularly useful for creating dashboard layouts, content galleries, form sections, or any interface requiring consistent spacing and alignment of multiple elements. The LayoutGrid provides developers with fine-grained control over display behavior, styling, and user interaction while maintaining accessibility and performance optimization.
