## Available CSS Classes

- **`app-panel-rtl`** - Provides right-to-left text direction support for the panel

### Theme Variant Classes
- **`panel-danger`** - Applies danger/error theme styling with red color scheme
- **`panel-default`** - Applies the default neutral theme styling
- **`panel-info`** - Applies informational theme styling with blue color scheme
- **`panel-primary`** - Applies primary theme styling with the main brand colors

Theme variant classes are typically used to convey different states or importance levels of the panel content. These classes modify the panel's border, background, and header colors to match their semantic meaning.
