# Callback Events

The Tooltip component does not expose specific callback events in the current implementation. Tooltip interactions are typically handled through the parent component or trigger element's events.

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| No events currently available | The tooltip component focuses on display functionality rather than user interaction events |

**Note**: To handle tooltip-related interactions, implement event handlers on the trigger elements that control the tooltip's `showTooltip` property.
