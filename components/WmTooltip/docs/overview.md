# Overview

The **Tooltip Component** is a UI element that displays contextual information when users interact with trigger elements. It provides a lightweight way to show helpful hints, descriptions, or additional details without cluttering the interface. Tooltips appear as small pop-up boxes with customizable text and styling, enhancing user experience by offering guidance and information on demand.

Tooltips are essential for improving app usability, especially in mobile applications where screen space is limited. They help users understand interface elements, provide context for actions, and deliver just-in-time information without navigating away from the current screen.
