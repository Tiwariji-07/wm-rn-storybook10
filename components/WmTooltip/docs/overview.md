# Overview

The Tooltip component is a fundamental UI element that provides contextual information or hints to users when they interact with specific interface elements. It displays additional text content in a small overlay that appears when users hover over or tap on a target element, helping to improve user experience by offering explanations, instructions, or supplementary details without cluttering the main interface.

This component is particularly valuable in mobile applications where screen real estate is limited and users need quick access to helpful information. Tooltips can enhance accessibility and usability by providing clarity about button functions, form field requirements, or feature explanations while maintaining a clean and unobtrusive design.
