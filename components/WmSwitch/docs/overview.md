# Overview

The **Switch widget** is a mobile-friendly input component that allows users to switch between 3 or more different options by pressing a single key. Unlike traditional toggle switches that only handle binary states, this Switch component can handle multiple predefined values, making it ideal for scenarios where users need to cycle through several options.

The Switch component extends the BaseDatasetProps class and provides a touch-optimized interface for mobile applications. It supports data binding, custom datasets, and various accessibility features to ensure a smooth user experience across different devices.
