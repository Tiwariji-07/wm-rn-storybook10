# Overview

The **Toggle widget** represents a physical switch that allows users to turn things on or off in mobile applications. Use Toggle controls to present users with exactly two mutually exclusive options (like on/off), where choosing an option results in an immediate action.

Toggles are ideal for binary choices and settings where users need immediate visual feedback. Unlike checkboxes, toggles suggest that the action will take effect immediately when the user flips the switch.
