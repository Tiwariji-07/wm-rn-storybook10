# Styling

The toggle component provides several CSS classes for customization and state management:

## Available CSS Classes

### `.app-toggle`
Default style class for the toggle component base styling.

### `.app-toggle-on`
Applied when the toggle is in the active/enabled state. Typically styles the toggle to appear "switched on" with appropriate visual indicators.

### `.app-toggle-off`
Applied when the toggle is in the inactive/disabled state. Styles the toggle to appear "switched off" with visual indicators showing the inactive state.

### `.app-toggle-rtl`
Right-to-left layout support class. Adjusts the toggle's visual appearance and animations for RTL text direction and layout requirements.

### `.app-toggle-disabled`
Applied when the toggle is disabled and non-interactive. Typically reduces opacity, changes cursor behavior, and applies visual styling to indicate the component cannot be interacted with.

These classes can be customized in your CSS to match your application's design system and branding requirements.
