# Overview

The Bar Chart widget is a versatile data visualization component that displays data using horizontal or vertical bars. It's ideal for comparing values across different categories and showing relationships between data points in an intuitive graphical format.

Bar charts excel at representing categorical data and are particularly effective when comparing multiple data series or when category names are long (horizontal orientation works best in such cases). The component supports various view types including grouped, stacked, and expanded arrangements.
