# Overview

The Donut Chart component is a specialized visualization widget that displays data in a circular format with a hollow center. Built on the foundation of pie charts, donut charts provide an effective way to represent proportional data while offering space in the center for additional information such as totals or custom labels.

Donut charts excel at showing the composition of data and are particularly useful when you need to compare parts of a whole while maintaining visual clarity. The hollow center distinguishes them from traditional pie charts and can be utilized to display summary information or custom content.
