# Overview

The Donut Chart component is a specialized data visualization widget designed for mobile applications that need to display proportional data in an engaging, circular format. Built on the WmPieChartProps base class, this component renders data as segments of a ring-shaped chart with a hollow center, making it ideal for displaying percentages, distributions, or comparative values in dashboards, analytics screens, and reporting interfaces.

This component is particularly effective for mobile interfaces where screen real estate is limited, as the center hollow space can be utilized to display key metrics, totals, or summary information while maintaining the visual appeal and clarity of the data presentation. The donut chart format provides better readability than traditional pie charts and offers a modern, professional appearance suitable for business and consumer applications.
