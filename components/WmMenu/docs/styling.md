# Styling

The following CSS classes are available for styling the menu component:

## Component-Specific Classes

### `app-menu`
Default style class for the menu component. This class provides the base styling and layout for the menu structure.

### `app-menu-rtl`
Applies right-to-left (RTL) layout styling to the menu component. This class adjusts text direction, alignment, and positioning to support RTL languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, or Persian.

## Additional Styling

Beyond these component-specific classes, you can also apply standard application CSS classes to further customize the menu's appearance and behavior.
