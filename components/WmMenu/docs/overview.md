# Overview

The **Menu** component is a navigation widget that displays grouped actions in a dropdown format. It's commonly used in navigation headers to show a list of related links when triggered by user interaction. The Menu component provides a flexible way to create both command menus (that initiate actions) and navigation menus (that take users to different locations).

The Menu widget supports dynamic data binding from variables or databases, allowing you to create rich menu structures with labels, icons, links, and nested sub-menus. It offers customizable layouts and animations to enhance the user experience.
