# Styling

The search component provides the following CSS classes for customization:

## Available CSS Classes

### `.app-search`
Default style class for the search component base styling.

### `.app-search-disabled`
Applied when the search component is in a disabled state, typically featuring reduced opacity and preventing user interaction.

### `.app-search-rtl`
Provides right-to-left (RTL) layout support for the search component, adjusting text direction and element positioning for RTL languages.

### `.app-autocomplete`
Styles the autocomplete functionality within the search component, controlling the appearance of dropdown suggestions and completion features.

## Usage

These classes can be overridden or extended in your custom CSS to match your application's design requirements. Standard application-wide CSS classes can also be applied to further customize the component's appearance.
