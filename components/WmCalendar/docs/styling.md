# Styling

The calendar component provides the following CSS classes for customization:

## Available CSS Classes

### `.app-calendar`
Default style class for the calendar component. This class provides the base styling for the calendar layout, including typography, spacing, and default color scheme.

### `.app-calendar-rtl`
Right-to-left (RTL) style class for the calendar component. This class applies RTL-specific styling adjustments, including reversed layout direction, flipped navigation elements, and appropriate text alignment for RTL languages such as Arabic or Hebrew.
