# Styling

The tile component provides several CSS classes for customization and visual styling.

## Available CSS Classes

### Component-Specific Classes

- **`.app-tile`** - Default style class that provides the base styling for the tile component
- **`.tile-template-text`** - Applies text-specific formatting and layout styles for tile content containing textual elements
- **`.well`** - Creates a recessed, bordered container effect with subtle background styling to make the tile appear inset

## Usage

These classes can be applied individually or combined to achieve the desired visual appearance for your tile components. When no specific styling is needed, the component will fall back to standard application classes for consistent theming across your interface.
