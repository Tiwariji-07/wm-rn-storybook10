# Styling

## Available CSS Classes

The icon component provides the following specific CSS classes for styling:

### `.app-icon`
Default style class that provides the base styling for icon components. This class establishes the fundamental appearance properties such as size, color, and positioning for icons throughout the application.

### `.app-icon-rtl`
Right-to-left (RTL) style class that provides appropriate styling adjustments for icon components in RTL layouts. This class typically handles mirroring, positioning, and spacing modifications needed for proper icon display in right-to-left reading languages and layouts.

## Additional Styling

In addition to these component-specific classes, you can also apply standard application utility classes for further customization of spacing, colors, and other visual properties.
