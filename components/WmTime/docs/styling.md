# Styling

## CSS Classes

No specific styling classes are available for the time component.

## Standard Styling

You can apply standard application CSS classes and custom styles to customize the appearance of the time component. This includes:

- Layout classes for positioning and spacing
- Typography classes for font styling
- Color classes for text and background colors
- Border and shadow utilities
- Custom CSS classes for component-specific styling

The time component will inherit styling from its parent container and can be targeted with standard CSS selectors for further customization.
