# Styling

## CSS Classes

The fileupload component provides the following CSS class for styling customization:

### Component-Specific Classes

| Class Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `app-fileupload` | Default style class that applies base styling to the file upload component container |

The `app-fileupload` class serves as the primary styling hook for the file upload component, allowing you to customize the overall appearance, layout, and visual properties of the upload interface including the drop zone, file selection button, and progress indicators.

## Additional Styling

Beyond the component-specific class, you can utilize standard application CSS classes and custom styles to further customize the appearance and behavior of the fileupload component to match your application's design system.
