# Styling

## CSS Classes

The checkbox component supports the following CSS classes for styling:

### Component-Specific Classes

- **`.app-checkbox`** - Default style class that provides the base styling for the checkbox component
- **`.app-checkbox-disabled`** - Applied to disabled checkbox instances, typically providing visual indicators such as reduced opacity, grayed-out appearance, or altered cursor states to show the component is not interactive

### Additional Styling

Beyond the component-specific classes listed above, you can also apply standard application CSS classes to further customize the checkbox appearance and behavior.
