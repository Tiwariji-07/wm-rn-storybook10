# Callback Events

The `linearlayout` component does not expose any specific callback events. Event handling should be implemented on the child components contained within the layout items.

## Child Component Events

The `linearlayoutitem` component also does not expose specific events, as it serves as a container for other interactive widgets that handle their own events.
