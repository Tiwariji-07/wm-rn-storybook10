# Overview

The `linearlayout` component is a flexible container widget that arranges its child elements in a linear fashion, either horizontally or vertically. Built on the flexbox model, it provides precise control over the layout and alignment of UI elements in React Native applications.

This component can only contain `linearlayoutitem` components as direct children, which allows for sophisticated nested layouts and responsive design patterns. The `linearlayout` automatically handles space distribution among its children based on flexbox properties and provides built-in spacing and alignment options.
