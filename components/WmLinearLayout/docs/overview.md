# Overview

The LinearLayout component is a fundamental container component that arranges its child elements in a linear sequence, either horizontally or vertically. It serves as one of the most commonly used layout containers in mobile applications, providing developers with precise control over how UI elements are positioned and spaced relative to each other. This component is essential for creating structured, organized interfaces where elements need to be aligned in a predictable, linear fashion.

LinearLayout excels in scenarios where you need to create rows or columns of content, such as form layouts, navigation bars, button groups, or any interface where elements should flow in a single direction with consistent spacing and alignment. Its flexible alignment and spacing options make it suitable for both simple layouts and more complex nested arrangements.
