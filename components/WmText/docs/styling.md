# Styling

## CSS Classes

The text component provides the following CSS classes for styling:

### Component-Specific Classes

- **`.app-text`** - Default style class that provides the base styling for the text component
- **`.app-text-disabled`** - Applied when the text component is in a disabled state, typically styling the text with reduced opacity or muted colors
- **`.app-text-rtl`** - Enables right-to-left text direction support for languages such as Arabic or Hebrew
- **`.app-text-with-label`** - Applied when the text component is displayed alongside a label, providing appropriate spacing and alignment

### Usage

These classes can be combined as needed to achieve the desired visual appearance. In addition to the component-specific classes, the text component can utilize standard application CSS classes for further customization.
