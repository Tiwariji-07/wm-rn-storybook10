# Overview

The `selectlocale` component is a specialized input widget designed for internationalization and localization in mobile applications. It provides users with an intuitive interface to select their preferred language from available locales, automatically adapting the application's interface to display content in the chosen language.

This component automatically detects the user's preferred locales from the device settings and renders the application accordingly. If the preferred locale is not supported, it falls back to the default language configured in the application settings.
