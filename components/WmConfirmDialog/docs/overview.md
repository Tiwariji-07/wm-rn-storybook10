# Overview

Confirm Dialog is a modal component used to get user confirmation before proceeding with critical actions. It displays a message along with OK and Cancel buttons, making it ideal for confirming destructive operations like deletes, important form submissions, or navigation away from unsaved content.

The component automatically handles user interaction and provides callback events for both confirmation and cancellation actions. It can be customized with different messages, button texts, icons, and styling to match your application's design requirements.
