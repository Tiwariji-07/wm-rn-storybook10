# Styling

## Available CSS Classes

No specific CSS classes are defined for the liveform component.

## General Styling

Since no component-specific CSS classes are available, you can use standard application classes and custom CSS to style the liveform component. The component will inherit styles from its parent containers and can be targeted using standard CSS selectors.

You may apply styling through:
- Global CSS rules
- Parent container classes
- Direct element targeting
- CSS-in-JS solutions
- Utility classes from your CSS framework
