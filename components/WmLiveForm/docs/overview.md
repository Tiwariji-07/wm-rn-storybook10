# Overview

The **Live Form** component provides a powerful data entry interface that automatically generates form fields based on your database schema. It seamlessly integrates with WaveMaker's Database CRUD variables to perform create, read, update, and delete operations through auto-generated REST APIs.

Live Form excels at handling database operations with minimal configuration. When bound to a database variable, it automatically creates appropriate input fields for each column, handles validation, and provides built-in CRUD functionality. The component can be associated with selected items from Lists or Data Tables to enable update operations on existing records.
