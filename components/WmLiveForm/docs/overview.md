# Overview

The **liveform** component is a dynamic data collection component designed to create interactive forms that respond to user input in real-time. This component enables developers to build sophisticated form interfaces that can validate, transform, and react to data changes as users interact with form fields, providing immediate feedback and a seamless user experience.

Built for mobile applications that require complex data entry workflows, the liveform component excels in scenarios such as user registration, profile updates, survey collection, and multi-step data capture processes.
