# Overview

The Accordion is a container component that displays a vertically stacked list of collapsible panels called accordion panes. Only one panel is typically expanded at a time, allowing users to navigate through content in an organized, space-efficient manner. Each accordion pane consists of a header with title, optional icon, and badge, plus expandable content that can contain other widgets or partial pages.

The Accordion component is ideal for organizing related content sections, FAQs, navigation menus, or any scenario where you need to present multiple content areas in a compact, user-friendly interface.
