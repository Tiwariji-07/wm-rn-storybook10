# Overview

The **Accordion** component is a collapsible container that displays content in stacked panels, where only one panel can be expanded at a time by default. It's ideal for organizing related content in a space-efficient manner, allowing users to focus on specific sections while keeping other content easily accessible.

Accordions consist of multiple accordion panes, each containing a header with title, optional subheading, and expandable content area. The component supports both inline content and partial page integration, making it versatile for various mobile app layouts.
