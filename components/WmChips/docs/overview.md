# Overview

The Chips component is an interactive input control that allows users to select and manage multiple items in a compact, tag-like format. It provides a user-friendly way to handle multi-selection scenarios in mobile applications, displaying selected items as dismissible chips while offering search and filtering capabilities for easy item discovery. This component is particularly useful for tagging systems, contact selection, category filtering, and any interface where users need to manage a collection of related items.

Built on the BaseDatasetProps foundation, the Chips component combines the functionality of a search input with visual chip representation of selections. It streamlines the user experience by reducing screen real estate usage while maintaining clear visibility of selected items, making it ideal for forms, filters, and data entry scenarios in mobile interfaces.
