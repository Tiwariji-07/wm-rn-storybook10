# Overview

The Chips component represents complex entities in small, manageable blocks such as contacts, tags, or categories. It provides an intuitive interface for selecting multiple items from a dataset or allowing users to create new entries through typed input. The component is particularly useful for recipient selection, tagging systems, and multi-value input scenarios in mobile applications.

Chips offer a more visually rich and directly manipulable alternative to traditional list-based interfaces, allowing users to manage selections by touching individual tokens and providing search/autocomplete functionality for efficient data entry.
