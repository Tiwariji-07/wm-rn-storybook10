# Styling

## CSS Classes

The following CSS classes are available for customizing the chips component:

### Component-Specific Classes

- **`app-chips`** - Default style class that provides the base styling for the chips component
- **`app-chips-disabled`** - Applied to chips in a disabled state, typically reducing opacity and preventing user interaction

## Usage

Apply these classes directly to the chips component to achieve the desired visual appearance. The base `app-chips` class should be used for standard styling, while `app-chips-disabled` can be applied when the component needs to appear inactive or non-interactive.

You can also use standard application CSS classes in combination with these component-specific classes for additional customization.
