# Styling

The currency component provides the following CSS classes for customization:

## Available CSS Classes

### `.app-currency`
Default style class that provides the base styling for the currency component.

### `.app-currency-rtl`
Applies right-to-left (RTL) text direction styling for languages that read from right to left, such as Arabic or Hebrew.

### `.app-currency-disabled`
Applied when the currency component is in a disabled state, typically reducing opacity and preventing user interaction.

### `.app-currency-with-label`
Used when the currency component includes an associated label, providing appropriate spacing and layout adjustments.

## Additional Styling

You can also apply standard application CSS classes alongside these component-specific classes to further customize the appearance and behavior of the currency component.
