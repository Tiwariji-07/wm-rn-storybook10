# Styling

## CSS Classes

The following CSS classes are available for styling the Lottie component:

### Component-Specific Classes

| Class Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `app-lottie` | Default style class for the Lottie component container |

The `app-lottie` class serves as the base styling foundation for Lottie animation components, providing default appearance and layout properties for the animation container.

## Additional Styling

Beyond the component-specific class, you can also apply standard application CSS classes and custom styles to further customize the appearance and behavior of your Lottie animations.
