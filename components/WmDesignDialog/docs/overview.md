# Overview

The Dialog component provides a modal popup window for displaying additional content, forms, or user interactions. It creates a view containing the dialog that can be triggered programmatically or through user interactions. The dialog overlays the main content and can be configured to be modal or non-modal.

Dialogs are commonly used for collecting user input, displaying detailed information, confirmation prompts, or presenting forms without navigating away from the current screen.
