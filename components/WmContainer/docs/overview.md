# Overview

The Container component is a fundamental layout element that serves as a versatile wrapper for organizing and structuring content within mobile applications. It provides a flexible foundation for grouping related UI elements while offering enhanced functionality beyond basic view containers.

This component extends PartialHostProps to deliver essential container capabilities including scroll management, sticky positioning, and smooth animations.
