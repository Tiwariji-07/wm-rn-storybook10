# Overview

The **Container** is a versatile layout component that serves as an empty box for organizing and grouping other components. It acts as a fundamental building block for creating structured layouts in React Native applications, allowing you to arrange content semantically and apply styling for visual organization.

Container components are essential for creating responsive layouts and can be used to wrap content that needs to be grouped together with specific styling, animations, or behavioral properties. They support both static content and dynamic partial page inclusion.

**Features:**
- Flexible layout direction (row/column) with wrap capabilities
- Built-in scroll support for content overflow
- Sticky positioning with opacity control
- Animation support with configurable delays
- Touch and gesture event handling
- Gap and alignment control for child elements
- Conditional styling and theming support
