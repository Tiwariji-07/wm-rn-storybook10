# Styling

The container component provides several CSS classes for different styling approaches:

## Available Classes

### `.app-container`
Default style class for basic container styling with standard padding and layout properties.

### `.media-body`
Styles the container as a flexible media body element, typically used for content that flows alongside media elements with automatic width adjustment.

### `.media-right`
Positions the container to the right side of a media layout, commonly used for secondary content or actions in media object patterns.

### `.app-elevated-container`
Applies elevation styling to the container, typically adding shadow effects to create a raised appearance above the background surface.

### `.app-outlined-container`
Applies border styling to the container, creating a outlined appearance with defined edges and boundaries.

You can combine these classes or use them individually depending on your design requirements. Standard application-wide CSS classes can also be applied for additional customization.
