# Overview

The DateTime component is a versatile input control designed for collecting date and time information in mobile applications. It provides users with an intuitive interface for selecting dates, times, or both, depending on the configured mode. This component is essential for forms, scheduling interfaces, booking systems, and any application feature that requires temporal data input.

Built on the BaseProps foundation, the DateTime component offers extensive customization options including date range restrictions, locale-specific formatting, and multiple display modes.
