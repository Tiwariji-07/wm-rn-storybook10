# Styling

The datetime component provides the following CSS classes for customization:

## Available CSS Classes

### `.app-datetime`
Default style class for the datetime component. This is the base class applied to all datetime instances and contains the foundational styling properties.

### `.app-datetime-disabled`
Applied when the datetime component is in a disabled state. This class typically modifies the visual appearance to indicate that the component is not interactive, such as reduced opacity, grayed-out colors, or different cursor styles.

### `.app-datetime-rtl`
Applied when the datetime component is rendered in right-to-left (RTL) layout mode. This class adjusts the component's styling to properly support RTL languages and text direction.

### `.app-datetime-with-label`
Applied when the datetime component includes an associated label element. This class provides appropriate spacing and layout adjustments to accommodate the label positioning and styling.

You can override these classes or combine them with standard application CSS classes to achieve the desired visual appearance for your datetime components.
