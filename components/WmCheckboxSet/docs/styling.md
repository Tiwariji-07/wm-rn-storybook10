# Styling

## Available CSS Classes

The CheckboxSet component provides the following specific CSS classes for styling:

### `.app-checkboxset`
Default style class that provides the base styling for the checkbox set component.

### `.app-checkboxset-disabled`
Applied when the checkbox set is in a disabled state, typically providing visual indicators such as reduced opacity, grayed-out appearance, or altered cursor behavior to show the component is not interactive.

## Additional Styling

In addition to the component-specific classes listed above, you can use standard application CSS classes to further customize the appearance and layout of the CheckboxSet component.
