# Overview

The column-chart component is a data visualization widget that displays categorical data using vertical bars or columns. It extends the WmBarChartProps base class to provide a clean and intuitive way to present comparative data in mobile applications. This component is ideal for showing trends, comparisons between different categories, or progress metrics where the height of each column represents the magnitude of values.

Column charts are particularly effective in mobile interfaces due to their clear visual hierarchy and touch-friendly design. They allow users to quickly understand data relationships at a glance, making them perfect for dashboards, analytics screens, reports, and any scenario where quantitative information needs to be communicated effectively within the constraints of a mobile screen.
