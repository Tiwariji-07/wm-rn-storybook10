# Styling

## Available CSS Classes

The form component provides the following specific CSS classes for customization:

### `.app-form`
Default style class for the form component. This class applies the standard form styling including layout, spacing, and visual presentation consistent with the application's design system.

### `.form-action`
Styles the action area of the form, typically containing buttons like submit, cancel, or reset. This class handles the positioning and spacing of form action elements to ensure proper alignment and visual hierarchy.

## Usage

Apply these classes to customize the appearance of your form component while maintaining consistency with the overall application design. You can also combine these classes with standard application utility classes for additional styling flexibility.
