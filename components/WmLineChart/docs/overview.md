# Overview

The Line Chart component is a versatile data visualization widget that displays data as a series of points connected by straight line segments. It's ideal for showing trends over time, comparing multiple data series, and visualizing continuous data relationships. Line charts excel at revealing patterns, trends, and changes in data over intervals.

Line charts are particularly effective for time-series data, performance tracking, and comparative analysis where you need to observe how values change and relate to each other across a continuous axis.
