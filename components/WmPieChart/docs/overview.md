# Overview

The pie chart component is a specialized chart widget that displays data in a circular format, where each segment represents a proportion of the whole dataset. It's ideal for showing the composition of data, such as market share distribution, demographic breakdowns, or any categorical data where you want to visualize parts of a whole.

The component extends the base chart functionality with pie-specific features like donut mode, customizable label placement, and center labels. It supports both traditional pie charts and donut charts (pie charts with a hollow center) through the `donutratio` property.
