# Styling

The progress-bar component provides several CSS classes for different visual styles and states.

## Available CSS Classes

### Base Class
- **`app-progress-bar`** - Default style class that provides the foundational styling for the progress bar component

### Theme Variants
- **`app-default-progress-bar`** - Applies the default theme styling with neutral colors
- **`app-success-progress-bar`** - Applies success theme styling, typically using green colors to indicate successful completion or positive progress
- **`app-info-progress-bar`** - Applies informational theme styling, typically using blue colors for general information or neutral progress states
- **`app-danger-progress-bar`** - Applies danger/error theme styling, typically using red colors to indicate errors, warnings, or critical states
- **`app-warning-progress-bar`** - Applies warning theme styling, typically using orange or yellow colors to indicate caution or attention-required states

## Usage

These classes can be applied to customize the appearance of the progress bar based on the context or state of the operation being tracked. The theme variant classes work in conjunction with the base `app-progress-bar` class to provide consistent styling while allowing for contextual color variations.
