# Overview

The progress-bar component is a fundamental UI element designed to visually represent the completion status or progress of tasks, operations, or data values within mobile applications. It provides users with immediate visual feedback about ongoing processes such as file uploads, form completion, loading states, or any measurable progress toward a goal.

This versatile component supports both determinate progress tracking (with specific min/max values) and indeterminate loading states, making it suitable for a wide range of scenarios from simple loading indicators to complex data visualization needs. Built with accessibility as a core consideration, it ensures all users can understand progress information regardless of their interaction method.
