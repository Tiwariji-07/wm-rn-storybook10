# Overview

The **Progress Bar** widget is a visual indicator used to show the completion status of tasks or processes in mobile applications. It displays progress as a horizontal bar that fills from left to right, representing a percentage of completion between minimum and maximum values. This component is essential for providing user feedback during loading operations, file uploads, form completion, or any process that takes time to complete.

The Progress Bar supports different visual states through type variations and can display tooltips for additional context. It's particularly useful in mobile applications where users need clear visual feedback about ongoing operations.
