# Overview

The Alert Dialog component provides a modal popup interface for displaying important messages, warnings, or notifications to users. It creates a focused user experience by presenting critical information that requires user acknowledgment before proceeding.

The component renders as an overlay dialog with customizable content, supporting different alert types (error, success, warning, information) with appropriate styling and iconography.
