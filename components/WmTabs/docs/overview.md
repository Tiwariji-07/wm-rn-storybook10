# Overview

The Tabs component is a versatile container component that provides a tabbed interface for organizing and displaying content in distinct panels. This component enables users to navigate between different sections of related content through clickable tab headers, making it ideal for organizing complex information, settings screens, product details, or any scenario where content needs to be categorized and accessed quickly without overwhelming the user interface.
