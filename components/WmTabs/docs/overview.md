# Overview

The **Tabs** component provides a tab-based navigation interface that allows multiple containers within a single window. It offers an easy and powerful mechanism to handle a large amount of content within a limited area by separating content into different panes where one pane is viewable at a time. Users can quickly access content by switching between panes without leaving the page.

Tabs implement a Tabbed Document Interface (TDI) that allows multiple documents or panels to be contained within a single window, serving as a navigational widget for switching between sets of documents.
