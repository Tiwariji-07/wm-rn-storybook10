# Styling

## Available CSS Classes

No specific CSS classes are available for the date component.

## Standard Styling Options

Since no component-specific classes are provided, you can use standard application CSS classes to customize the appearance of the date component. This includes:

- General layout classes for positioning and spacing
- Typography classes for font styling
- Color classes for text and background colors
- Border and shadow classes for visual effects
- Responsive design classes for different screen sizes

You can also apply custom CSS styles directly to the date component using standard CSS selectors.
