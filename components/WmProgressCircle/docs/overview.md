# Overview

The progress-circle component is a visual indicator that displays progress or completion status in a circular format. This component is commonly used in mobile applications to show loading states, task completion percentages, goal achievements, or any metric that benefits from a radial visualization. It provides users with an immediate visual understanding of progress through an intuitive circular design that clearly communicates how much of a process or goal has been completed.

The component offers flexible configuration options to accommodate various use cases, from simple loading indicators to complex data visualizations with detailed labeling and accessibility features.
