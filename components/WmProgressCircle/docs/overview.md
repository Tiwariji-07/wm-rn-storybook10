# Overview

The **Progress Circle** widget is a visual component designed to display the progress or completion status of tasks in mobile applications. It provides an intuitive circular representation that shows how much work has been completed relative to a total amount, making it ideal for indicating loading states, task completion, or any measurable progress.

This component can operate in two modes: determinate (showing specific progress between defined minimum and maximum values) or indeterminate (showing ongoing activity without specific completion metrics). The circular design is particularly effective in mobile interfaces where screen real estate is valuable.
