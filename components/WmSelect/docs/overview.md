# Overview

The Select widget provides a way for users to select an item from a drop-down list of choices in mobile applications. It renders as a native picker on mobile devices, offering an intuitive touch-friendly interface for single-item selection. The component supports data binding to variables and can display complex data structures with customizable display expressions.

The Select widget is ideal for scenarios where users need to choose from a predefined set of options, such as selecting countries, categories, or any enumerated values. It automatically handles the native mobile presentation and provides seamless integration with WaveMaker's data binding system.
