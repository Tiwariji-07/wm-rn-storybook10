# Overview

The Select widget provides a way for users to select an item from a drop-down list of choices in mobile applications. It creates an interactive dropdown interface that allows users to choose from predefined options, making it ideal for forms, filters, and configuration screens. The selection can be captured through the `displayValue` property.
