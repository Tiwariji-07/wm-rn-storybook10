# Overview

The **Textarea** component is a multi-line plain text input control designed for React Native applications. It provides a rich text input experience for scenarios requiring longer text content such as comments, feedback forms, descriptions, or any multi-line text entry.

The component extends BaseInputProps and offers comprehensive input validation, character counting, accessibility features, and customizable behavior options. It's particularly useful when you need users to enter paragraphs of text rather than single-line inputs.
