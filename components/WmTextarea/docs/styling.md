# Styling

The textarea component provides the following CSS classes for customization:

## Available CSS Classes

### `.app-textarea`
Default style class that applies the standard textarea appearance and behavior.

### `.app-textarea-disabled`
Applied when the textarea is in a disabled state, typically providing visual indicators such as reduced opacity, grayed-out appearance, or altered cursor behavior to show the field is not interactive.

### `.app-textarea-rtl`
Enables right-to-left text direction support for the textarea, adjusting text alignment, padding, and any directional elements to accommodate RTL languages such as Arabic or Hebrew.

### `.app-textarea-with-label`
Applied when the textarea is used in conjunction with a label element, providing appropriate spacing, alignment, and visual relationship between the label and textarea field.

You can also use standard application CSS classes in combination with these component-specific classes to further customize the appearance and layout of the textarea component.
