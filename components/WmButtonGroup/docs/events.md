# Callback Events

The Button Group component itself does not emit specific events. However, individual button components within the group will have their own event handlers such as `onTap`, `onTouchstart`, and `onTouchend`. Event handling is managed at the individual button level within the group.

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| No component-level events | Events are handled by individual button components within the group |
