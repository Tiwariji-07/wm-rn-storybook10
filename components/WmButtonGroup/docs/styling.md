# Styling

The ButtonGroup component provides the following CSS classes for customization:

## Available CSS Classes

### `.app-buttongroup`
The default style class applied to the button group container. This class defines the base styling and layout for the entire button group component.

### `.btn-group-child`
Applied to individual button elements within the group. This class handles the styling for buttons that are part of the group, typically managing borders, spacing, and alignment between adjacent buttons.

### `.btn-group-first-child`
Applied to the first button in the group. This class manages special styling for the leftmost button, such as preserving the left border radius while removing the right border radius for seamless connection to adjacent buttons.

### `.btn-group-last-child`
Applied to the last button in the group. This class handles special styling for the rightmost button, such as preserving the right border radius while removing the left border radius for seamless connection to adjacent buttons.

These classes work together to create a cohesive visual appearance where buttons appear as a unified group with shared borders and consistent styling.
