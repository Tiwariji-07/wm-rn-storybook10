# Overview

The **Button Group** component is a container widget that organizes a set of buttons into a cohesive group for better visual presentation and management. It provides a clean way to display related actions together, making the interface more intuitive and organized.

Button groups are particularly useful when you need to present multiple related actions for a single entity, such as media controls (play, pause, stop) or editing operations (edit, delete, share). The buttons can be arranged either horizontally or vertically based on your layout requirements.
