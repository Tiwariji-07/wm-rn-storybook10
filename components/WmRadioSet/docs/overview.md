# Overview

The RadioSet component is a mobile input control that displays a collection of radio button options in a structured layout, allowing users to select a single option from a dataset. This component is particularly useful for forms, settings screens, and selection interfaces where users need to choose one item from a predefined list of options, with the ability to display data in a grid format or scrollable list.

Built on the BaseDatasetProps foundation, the RadioSet component provides robust data binding capabilities and flexible presentation options. It excels in scenarios where you need to present multiple choice selections with clear visual organization, making it ideal for preference settings, category selections, or any single-choice input requirements in mobile applications.
