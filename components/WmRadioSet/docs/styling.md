# Styling

## Available CSS Classes

The radioset component provides the following CSS classes for styling:

### Component-Specific Classes

| Class Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `app-radioset` | Default style class applied to the radioset component |
| `app-radioset-disabled` | Applied when the radioset is in a disabled state, typically rendering options with reduced opacity and preventing user interaction |

### Usage

Apply these classes directly to the radioset component to control its visual appearance. The `app-radioset-disabled` class is automatically applied when the component's disabled property is set to true.

You can also use standard application CSS classes in combination with these component-specific classes to achieve custom styling requirements.
