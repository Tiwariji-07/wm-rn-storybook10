# Overview

The Camera component is a device-based UI element that provides native camera functionality within mobile applications. It enables users to capture photos or videos directly through the app interface, offering seamless integration with the device's camera hardware while maintaining consistent styling and behavior across different platforms.

This component serves as a bridge between your application and the device's camera capabilities, allowing developers to implement photo and video capture features with customizable settings and quality controls. The captured media can be processed, stored locally, or uploaded to remote services based on your application's requirements.
