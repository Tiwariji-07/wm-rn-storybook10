# Styling

The wizard component provides the following CSS classes for styling customization:

## Available CSS Classes

### `.app-wizard`
Default style class for the wizard component. This is the base class that applies the standard wizard styling and layout.

### `.number-text-inline`
Styles the step numbers to display inline with text content, creating a horizontal layout for the step indicators and labels.

### `.progress-circle-header`
Applies circular progress indicator styling to the wizard header, displaying step progress as filled circles rather than default indicators.

### `.app-wizard-rtl`
Enables right-to-left (RTL) layout support for the wizard component, reversing the visual flow and positioning of elements to accommodate RTL languages.

You can combine these classes or use them individually to achieve the desired visual appearance for your wizard component. Additionally, standard application CSS classes can be applied for further customization.
