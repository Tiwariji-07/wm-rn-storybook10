# Overview

The Wizard component is a container widget that guides users through multi-step processes in a structured manner. It provides a step-by-step interface suitable for tasks that have multiple independent steps, allowing users to navigate through each step to comprehend complex tasks in an organized way.

Wizards are particularly useful for scenarios like online payments, product orders, document reviews, software installations, account registrations, and project configurations. The component includes navigation controls (Previous/Next buttons), a Done button for completion, and Cancel functionality for exit at any step.
