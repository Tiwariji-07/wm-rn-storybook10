# Overview

The Carousel component is a flexible, responsive slider widget that allows you to display a series of images, content, or any other type of media in a rotating slideshow format. It supports both touch gestures and automatic animation, making it ideal for showcasing featured content, image galleries, or promotional materials in mobile applications.
