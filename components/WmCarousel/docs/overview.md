# Overview

The Carousel component is an advanced UI element designed for displaying multiple content items in a horizontally scrollable, swipeable interface within mobile applications. This component is ideal for showcasing image galleries, product listings, onboarding screens, promotional banners, or any collection of related content that benefits from a slide-based presentation format.

Built on the BaseProps foundation, the Carousel component provides a rich, interactive experience that allows users to navigate through content using touch gestures, automatic transitions, or manual controls. It's particularly effective for highlighting featured content, creating engaging user onboarding flows, or presenting visual content in a space-efficient manner while maintaining an intuitive and familiar user interaction pattern.
