# Styling

The carousel component provides the following CSS classes for customization:

## Component-Specific Classes

### `.app-carousel`
Default style class for the carousel component. This applies the base styling and layout for the carousel container and its elements.

### `.app-carousel-rtl`
Enables right-to-left (RTL) layout for the carousel. This class adjusts the carousel's direction, navigation controls, and slide transitions to support RTL languages and layouts.

### `.app-carousel-1`
First variant styling for the carousel. This class provides an alternative visual appearance or layout option for the carousel component.

### `.app-carousel-2`
Second variant styling for the carousel. This class offers another distinct visual styling or functional variation for the carousel component.

## Additional Styling

You can also apply standard application CSS classes alongside these component-specific classes to further customize the carousel's appearance and behavior.
