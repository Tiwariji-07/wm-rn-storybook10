# Overview

The BottomSheet component is a fundamental UI element that provides a sliding panel interface emerging from the bottom of the screen. This versatile component is commonly used in mobile applications to present additional content, actions, or forms without navigating away from the current screen context, offering users quick access to secondary information or controls while maintaining the primary view.

BottomSheet components enhance user experience by providing contextual interactions through a familiar gesture-based interface. They support various content types and can adapt to different screen sizes and use cases, making them ideal for mobile-first applications where screen real estate is premium and intuitive navigation patterns are essential.
