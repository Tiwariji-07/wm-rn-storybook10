# Styling

## Available CSS Classes

The navbar component supports the following specific CSS classes:

### `.app-navbar`
Default style class for the navbar component. This provides the base styling and layout for the navigation bar.

### `.stackedNav`
Applies a stacked layout to the navigation items, arranging them vertically rather than horizontally. Useful for mobile layouts or sidebar navigation.

### `.childNav`
Styles the navbar as a child or secondary navigation element. Typically used for sub-navigation menus with reduced visual prominence compared to the main navbar.

### `.justifiedNav`
Creates a justified layout where navigation items are evenly distributed across the full width of the container, with equal spacing between items.

## Usage

Apply these classes to customize the navbar appearance and layout according to your design requirements. Multiple classes can be combined to achieve the desired styling effect.
