# Overview

The bubble-chart component is a specialized data visualization tool designed for mobile applications that displays three-dimensional data relationships using bubbles positioned on a two-dimensional coordinate system. This component extends the BaseChartComponentProps to provide an interactive and visually appealing way to represent complex datasets where each bubble represents a data point with X and Y coordinates, while the bubble size or color can represent additional data dimensions.

This component is particularly useful for displaying correlations between multiple variables, comparative analysis, and identifying patterns or outliers in datasets. Common use cases include financial portfolio analysis, performance metrics visualization, market research data, and any scenario where users need to understand relationships between three or more data attributes simultaneously.
