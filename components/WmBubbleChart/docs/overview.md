# Overview

The Bubble Chart component is a powerful data visualization widget that enables you to display three-dimensional data in a two-dimensional format. Unlike traditional charts that only use X and Y axes, bubble charts use the size of bubbles as a third dimension to represent additional data values.

Bubble charts are ideal for displaying complex datasets where you need to show relationships between three variables simultaneously, such as comparing sales performance (X-axis), profit margins (Y-axis), and market share (bubble size) across different product categories.
