# Styling

## Available CSS Classes

The slider component provides the following specific CSS classes for customization:

### Component-Specific Classes

- **`app-slider`** - Default style class that applies the base styling to the slider component
- **`app-slider-disabled`** - Applied when the slider is in a disabled state, typically reducing opacity and preventing user interaction

## Usage

Apply these classes to customize the appearance and behavior of your slider component. The `app-slider` class provides the foundational styling, while `app-slider-disabled` handles the visual representation of the disabled state.

You can also use standard application CSS classes in combination with these component-specific classes for additional styling flexibility.
