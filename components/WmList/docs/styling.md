# Styling

The list component provides several CSS classes to control its appearance and layout:

## Available CSS Classes

### `app-list`
Default style class that provides the base styling for list components.

### `app-horizontal-list`
Arranges list items in a horizontal layout, displaying items side by side instead of vertically stacked.

### `app-vertical-list`
Arranges list items in a vertical layout, displaying items stacked one below the other (typically the default list behavior).

### `app-horizontal-list-dense`
Applies a horizontal layout with reduced spacing between items, creating a more compact horizontal arrangement.

### `app-list-dense`
Reduces the spacing and padding around list items, creating a more compact vertical list appearance.

## Usage

Apply these classes directly to your list component to achieve the desired visual presentation. You can also combine these classes with standard application CSS classes for additional customization.
