# Overview

The Popover component is a versatile navigation element that displays contextual information or interactive content in a floating overlay positioned relative to a trigger element. This component is ideal for presenting supplementary details, quick actions, or form inputs without navigating away from the current screen, making it perfect for mobile applications where screen real estate is precious and user context needs to be preserved.

Popovers enhance user experience by providing just-in-time information and maintaining workflow continuity. They can be triggered by user interactions or automatically displayed based on application logic, offering a non-intrusive way to present additional functionality or guidance while keeping users engaged with the primary interface.
