# Overview

The **Popover Widget** provides an interactive way to display additional content or navigation options in a lightweight overlay that appears on user interaction. Popovers are ideal for showing secondary information, action menus, or contextual controls without navigating away from the current screen. They maintain the original content visibility in the background while presenting focused, relevant information to users.

Popovers excel at providing contextual interactions - they appear when users perform specific actions or reach particular points in the app, showing relevant information or controls associated with that action. Users can easily dismiss popovers by tapping outside the content area or through configured auto-close behaviors, making them perfect for non-intrusive user experiences.
