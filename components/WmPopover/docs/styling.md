# Styling

The popover component provides several CSS classes for customization:

## Available CSS Classes

### `.app-popover`
Default style class for the base popover component. This class provides the fundamental styling and positioning for popover elements.

### `.app-popover-action-sheet`
Applies action sheet styling to the popover, typically creating a bottom-anchored modal-like appearance with a list of actionable options.

### `.popover-dropdown`
Creates a dropdown-style appearance for the popover, usually positioned relative to a trigger element with appropriate spacing and visual hierarchy.

## Additional Styling

You can also apply standard application CSS classes alongside these component-specific classes to further customize the appearance, spacing, and behavior of your popover components.
