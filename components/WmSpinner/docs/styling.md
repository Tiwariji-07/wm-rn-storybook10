# Styling

## Available CSS Classes

The spinner component provides the following specific styling classes:

### `.app-spinner`
Default style class that applies the standard spinner appearance and animation behavior.

### `.app-spinner-rtl`
Right-to-left (RTL) variant class that adjusts the spinner's animation direction and positioning for RTL language support and layouts.

## Additional Styling

In addition to the component-specific classes above, you can use standard application CSS classes to further customize the spinner's appearance, positioning, and behavior as needed.
